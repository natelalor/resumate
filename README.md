Tired of spending time and effort on each job application trying to appeal to the artificial intelligence (AI) that will automatically deny your application? We hope to change that.

This new job assistant combats AI, using AI. It automatically polishes and improves your resumes and cover letters to match the job you are applying for. 

Simply talk to our AI bot about your skills, knowledge, past work experience and the projects you’ve done, and when it comes time to apply to a job, sent it the job description. It will use enhanced algorithms to produce a new resume or cover letter that perfectly reflects your work using buzzwords and language that the recruiters are looking for.

It’s time to fight back, and get yourself a job.
